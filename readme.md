# Poet

This is yet another repository inspired by [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn) to do language modelling using recurrent neural networks.

It makes use of sequence generators in [blocks](https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks).

Requires:
 * Theano
 * Blocks
 * Fuel

Just save your input file as ```datasets/input.txt``` and you're ready to go:
```python poet/poet.py```
